“First, start in a plank position. Your hands should be placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, with your fingers pointing forward.”

“Make sure your body forms a straight line from your head to your heels. Engage your core to maintain that straight line—don't let your hips sag or pike up.”

“Now, as you lower your body, keep your elbows at about a 45-degree angle to your torso. Lower down until your chest nearly touches the floor.”

“Push through your palms to raise your body back to the starting position. Make sure to fully extend your arms without locking your elbows at the top.”

“And remember, breathing is key! Inhale as you lower and exhale as you push back up.”

“That's how to do a proper push-up! Focus on form over quantity to maximize your results and avoid injury.”
